Frost lord spells:

All spells are carried over into the next phase


Phase 1 100-75%
Frost blast - Deals a moderate ammount of frost damage to 1 target.
Icy Tomb - Traps 1 party member in a tomb (any non-frost damage breaks the tomb)
Creeping Permafrost - a chill falls over the room, at 100% all party members die.  (Casting fire spells reduces this)

Phase 2 75-50%  
Blizzard - Causes all party members to take minor frost damage at the end of each turn


Phase 3 50%-0
Shatter (cast at transition) Breaks all Icy tombs killing party members that are trapped.
Spawn Icicle* 


*Icicle:
When destroyed normally, or after 4 turns, falls on random party member dealing heavy damage.
Can be damaged by any non-frost spell.
Grows in size every turn (Increasing fall damage by 50%)
When damaged by a fire spell will instantly melt (killing the icicle and preventing it from falling) Causes Waterlogged*


*Waterlogged
All party members are covered in water and will automatically be effected by Icy Tomb after 3 turns.
Any fire damage removes Waterlogged.


Good luck :)
